# LSTM-Autoencoder-Based-Anomaly-Detection-for-Temporal-Climate-Data.
 An LSTM autoencoder model is employed to analyze historical temperature data from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Monthly (GHCN-M) dataset. The model is trained to identify anomalies in both global monthly mean temperatures and monthly temperatures for a specific location.
